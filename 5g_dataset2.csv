Radiation from wireless technology affects the blood, the heart, and the autonomic nervous system

What are the symptoms of
WIFI toxicity?
Do you suffer from insomnia, headaches, vertigo, nausea, heart palpitations, body aches or sporadic flu symptoms? These are all indications of exposure to electromagnetic field radiation (EMF).

EMF exposure can affect structure and function of cardiovascular system and may facilitate myocardial infarction by nuclear changing of cardiomyocytes.
Exposure to EMFs induced pain or pressure in the chest area, heart palpitations and/or an irregular heartbeat.
@ https://medcraveonline. Com 

A 1992 Russian study found that frequencies in the range 53-78GHz (that which 5G proposes to use) impacted the heart rate variability (an indicator of stress) in rats.
Another Russian study on frogs who's skin was exposed to MMWs found heart rate changes (arrhythmias).

Yes, 5Ghz WiFi can go through walls, but it is more likely to be weakened or blocked by obstacles like walls, floors, and ceilings. 5Ghz WiFi is best suited for smaller areas with fewer obstacles, where the signal can reach further, and speeds can remain higher.

Because 5G waves function at a higher frequency, they're more powerful, but also shorter in length.
This is the primary reason why new infrastructure is required for 5G deployment: the waves have different characteristics. Shorter waves, for example, will see more interference from obiects like trees and skyscrapers, and even droplets of rain or flakes of snow.
That, in effect, is why small cells are installed on utility poles. In cities, especially, 5G is fast and powerful, but can't travel well through walls or other obstructions. So the more relay points you have, the better the signal will be. After all, you wouldn't want a connected autonomous vehicle to
cruise down the freeway with ease, only to lose signal as soon as it drives between two tall building.

5G operates at a higher frequency than other communication standards we're used to, like 3G, 4G, or LTE. Those networks work at frequencies between about 1 to 6 gigahertz, while experts say
5G sits closer to the band between 24 and 90 gigahertz.

The volunteers did not know when the phone was on or off and 40 percent of subjects had a moderate to severe reaction only when the phone's base station was on and emitting microwaves. Those who responded experienced

The average amount of data utilized in India each individual uses each month is currently 20 GB, and by 2027, that amount is expected to rise to 50 GB, according to [**Nunzio Mirtillo in an exclusive interview with Business Today.** ](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/exclusive-indias-average-data-consumption-to-rise-up-to-50gb-per-month-by-2027-says-nunzio-mirtillo-of-ericsson-348789-2022-10-02)

Apple has updated its iOS, adding [**5G suppor**](https://www.aptronixindia.com/newsroom/post/experience-the-superfast-5g-network-on-your-iphone/)**t** for a select few iPhone models. Better features including granular controls for AOD (always-On display) mode, the Free-form app, the Sing alongside functionality for Apple Music, Crash Detection, privacy, and security in many locations are provided by the [**new iOS 16.2**](https://www.apple.com/in/ios/ios-16/) software version. India's 5G networks can now support iPhones.

Here you may find a list of iPhones that can receive the software update needed to support 5G networks. 

Apple SE iPhone (2022), Apple's iPhones 12 and 13, Apple's iPhone 13-Mini, Apple's iPhone 13 Pro, Apple's iPhone 13 Pro Max, Apple's iPhone 14, and Apple's iPhone 14 Plus 

## How can I turn on 5G on my iPhone from Apple? 

The iOS 16.2 update for iPhones in India adds support for 5G networks. To activate 5G on an Apple iPhone, go to Settings > Mobile Data > Mobile Data Options > Voice & Data.

You can now choose to use 5G On or 5G Auto.

Since 5G is only activated when it is required, 5G Auto makes Smart Data mode possible and prolongs battery life. 

When a 5G network is available, it is always used. Battery life can suffer as a result. 

Now that 5G is active, you can choose a data mode from the mobile data choices menu. There are three options for settings: In low data, standard, and 5G modes, permit more data. 

Increase 5G data usage: When the Wi-Fi connection is slow, your iPhone will instantly switch to 5G. As a result, more data will be available for use by applications and system activities. 

You will be able to download iOS updates through cellular networks as well as run high definition and high quality apps.

**Standard**: This option enables automatic updates for mobile devices and uses standard video and FaceTime quality settings. Usually, this is the default position. 

**Low Data Mode:** This setting prevents Wi-Fi or cellular networks from being used to transfer data for automated updates and background tasks.

Better speed sums up everything in the first place. Fewer disconnects, smooth transmission, and reliable connections are possible benefits of 5G networks. Some of the key benefits of 5G networks are detailed below.

### 1. Enhanced Bandwidth

The better bandwidth of the 5G network allows users to use **voice and data services seamlessly**. Users have more space to stream and download data without hassle as bandwidth increases.

### 2. Reduce tower obstruction

Tower obstacles are currently the most common problem with 4G LTE technology. Many users must **rely on tower signals** that tend to be disturbed and affect their influence capacity.

However, with 5G networks, this is no longer a problem as there are no tower collisions. In other words, 5G networks provide more bandwidth capacity as users can access internet-based services without obstacles. Tower obstacles are currently the most common problem with 4G LTE technology.

Many users must rely on tower signals that tend to be disturbed and affect their influence capacity. However, with 5G networks, this is no longer a problem as there are no tower collisions. In other words, 5G networks provide more bandwidth capacity as users can access internet-based services without obstacles.

### 3. Tremendous speed

Perfect transfer speed is perhaps one of the **Ones installing a 5G tower around** **it**. You can perfectly transfer speed access internet services at much faster speeds and **download HD programs in minutes**.

People have to grapple with 3G and 4G speeds. 5G bandwidth has minor network congestion, so it's faster, making high-definition content much easier to access.

### 4. Technology Advancement

When you think strongly, more robust possibilities lead to more prominent inventions. The Internet of Things (IoT) will be at your fingertips, from health to finance.

More technological advances will open the door to the invention of more intelligent devices based on **VR and artificial intelligence** that were previously unavailable.

### 5. Connect PC and Handset

Advanced 5G networks are much better than dedicated Internet access points, and users can save money at an **additional fee**.

Users can use their mobile phones as an internet access point and use 5G bandwidth for multiple devices simultaneously. With minimal transmission-related disruptions, 5G networks are seamless and effective for various devices in your home or office.

### What are the disadvantages of 5G networks?

Taking two steps ahead is taking the world a step back differently. These shortcomings of 5G networks will likely affect consumers in the future.

### 1. Healthcare

There is a lot of debate about the **health risk claims posed by 5G's higher radio frequency** (RF). Network operators continue to spray the bright side of 5G networks.

However, a recent National Toxicology Program study found that high levels of cell phone radiation in male rats increased carcinogenic activity by **6%**. However, the radiation emitted by the network is not part of the study.

### 2. Additional cost

Think about the cost of building new 5G network equipment, improving infrastructure, and maintaining telecommunications companies. All these costs eventually add **up to consumer costs**. Better service means users will have to spend much more to use advanced 5G technology.

### 3. Battery drain and device overheating

Disadvantages of 5G networks include **draining the user's mobile battery**. Mobile phone manufacturers must find good battery technology to cope with the drainage problems caused by high-frequency consumption.

Your phone is looking for a new access point, or your device *network antenna is draining more battery than usual*. So, the reduced 5G network coverage will eventually drain your mobile battery. Users are also expected to face device overheating issues after running their phones on 5G connections during overtime.

### 4. Broadcast distance

It is assumed that 5G networks will only be effective in densely populated areas. Another disadvantage of 5G networks is that frequencies can only transmit over short distances.

**WiFi**, for example, doesn't travel as far as 2.4 **GHz WiFi**, and **5G cellular cannot travel as far from towers**. Also, millimeter 5G radio waves are transmitted only linearly with the ability to see the building.

This ultimately boils down to more buildings, trees, walls, and other obstacles blocking or interfering with high-frequency signals. Abnormal weather conditions are another nightmare for 5G technology.

### 5. Upload speed consumes more data

While a user is searching for something on the Internet, data is transmitted through dual channels. Current technology offers upload speeds up to ***100 Mbps and download speeds as high as 1.9 Gbps***.

Given that 5G network speeds are exploding and costing more than ever, even small internet transactions will likely result in more data transfers.

### 6. Coverage issues in rural areas

Currently, 5G networks are a dream come true for urban areas. Speculation suggests that **carriers deploy 5G towers in densely populated** **areas** to provide robust data and voice services.

In contrast, people living in rural areas will not benefit from 5G networks. Many remote locations currently do not have access to any form of cellular connection.",1674900825.0

Generally, he was a level headed guy, and a very intelligent one too. currently he's working in film making. He is a Christian man but mostly never really believed in any conspiracy theories or anything (though, he almost became a flat earther but by the end of whatever he saw, he said it was bs) But sadly, after his wife passed away from COVID. It seems like a bunch of conspiracy groups prayed on that loss and managed to convince him that COVID is not a virus, but rather something caused by 5G. They've convinced him that there are trackers in the vaccine, and the government is planing to use AI transmitted by 5G to control people and that they are using it to send bio mechanical signals to the human body using 5G to give people medicine and kill others. Honestly I'm worried about him because it's getting to the point where is about ready to toss out all tech that requires a signal and is genuinely afraid of all strangers. We had came to his home a day or so ago for some car repairs and we called another mechanic to come help us and when we told him, he said ""No, no no, I don't trust strangers with anything, I don't like that."" and something along the lines of ""I can't let him bring that 5G shit near me"" honesty it's...sad. I really like the guy, my Mom has known him forever, but he's honestly sank deep into the conspiracy hole. The grief he has was taken advantage of and I really don't know how to help him out of it.

That is how and why it heats your food. It has to be something with water in it which is why your bowl doesn't heat up and your food does.

WITH BIDEN my book for funding publishing I offer, has infinite details of the 5G MICROWAVE CURRENT disorder of government and rich seeking to harm others with tortures of sound and diode/chip induced pain on pets, animals, mammals, humans, and anything to say can respond to Musk Sentient robotic technology and MIT brain exploration technologies force harmed into the World poulation by US Studies against humanity free thinking and safety welfare standards of life. Knocking in the towns reported for years in US is in the peoples heads with the gov military mics for sounds and listening for over 40 years now, and the whales, sea lions, seals, dolphins beached and blown up are the SpaceX microwave 5G Laser Technology like fire setting and explosions to Italy town as research using these evil MIT and elon Musk Sentient technologies on people. Stop the injections of vaccines to stop the spead of traveling teeny microchips in the body. Your eyes on the Havana Syndrome youtube connection to 5G harms to people by US I can see Mr. Secretary of State look injected underneath and appear possibly as the facial physical harms done to say research what brain feels when we are harmed like many of the harms police firemen and city workers are paid to do to others for fund raising insurance fraud payments each year end to federal gov, cities, and states supporting this group of COVID1-19 hazes since 1970 at least. COVID 1 was AIDS GOV & FBI killed many famous people like Freddie Mercury & George Michael who LA Police also fraudulently hazed in these evils for money and Sentient US GOV Military overtake Mr. Michael. COVID 2 IS HERPES FAKED ON MANY PEOPLE TO STOP SEXLIFE, RUIN FAMILY, FUND GOV FOR FRAUDULENT RESEARCH & DESTROY HOPE IN LIFE. Setting up task force, triage, medical studies, and reporting agencies done for years by you? Is one huge funnel of money out of needed funds to run a real American Government, not being run by anyone, and a payment for the rich fools in gov and military and police and fbi(fbi HUGE IN CUBA & OVERTAKING EVERYONE THERE IS EASILY ASSESSED)purposely caused against millions of people and this announcements is a creature features feel WAR OF THE WORLD SYNDROME IN & OF ITSELF. When I woke up this morning, in almost 2years gov whitehouse run phishingscam by evil thug trump & biden, to the 5G deficit on a body from microwave current harms that create COVID 19 fake Symptoms of phlegm, coughing, heavy mucus, nose bleeding, unbelievable face pain, etc. it was said that gov and biden dont want to turn this off on anyone to keep scaring people to think sick & buy expensive US VACCINES & due to money funnels to gov rich and presiding whitehouse employees for using 5G 364ghz microwave current as often as they can for research funding scams on the American Systems. 3G is 12ghz microwave current,, 4G is 34ghz microwave current, guess what was needed for COVI19 PUBLIC BREAKOUT FRAUD? 364ghz microwave currents!!!@#% So studies wont buy it, money wont buy it, love cant buy it, how you gonna stop US rich and gov experimenting on humans and decisive plans for humanity overtake of literally insane project plans COVID plagues on Countries by US, its developed so far now? Phishingscams involving many many gov personnel talk and knock torturers are an American gov & rich pastime at this late point in the human experiments and cash regulating funnels into private hands for personal wealth enrichment I cant write my whole book here, but I've put my witness statement proof of life onto Twitter as SmallDoll4(w/pictures) for over a year and gov with jack took up my entire record of evidence and stole/erased it, just like evey work on my now gone $5000 Quosmio Laptop they stole every bit of excellence as fbi hackers on every component in my life and said to have sold it to someone to write/produce against the victims statements laws in CA and US, plus endangering my life further to make it ever the for profit by others existence people pay gov for acceses to me for more harms. My CA Unemployment blocked right now & twice eqauls over 7 months of unpaid weeks to wreck my credit and stop my house payments to steal another high equity home from me in CA. Now CA sent this morning said I have 21 days to upload online my 2019 earnings???? And provide illegally forced online fraud hackable copy of my full CA ID Drivers License????? While my jobs also are removed by attacks at McDonalds Gustine CA, and Del Taco Santa Nella CA. My GOV BETRAYERS book settles Government fbi presidents online attacks and overtakes like these to endlessly mire us in rhetoric and time waste dangers of demands, and the whole trump evil serial killer phishingscams and stars lives overtakes in years and in/from the whitehouse that biden didnt stop upon entering these and owns many of these phishing scams for homes overtakes thru darkweb titles sold and resold in CA. What my Huxtible-Cosby Act would seek to solve additionally is stop the underworld title and bank(s) + especially Bank of the West frauds in this(on me now by BOW over 11 years costcostin tens of thousands $) on all and the overtake sale by rich and gov of entire lives, bodies of work, autos, businesses for rich absorption into their personal wealth schemes. Think these impossible death and prison groupings by fbi, gov, rich, destroying people for money: BILL COSBY SON SIDE OF HIGHWAY MURDER & THEN BILL COSBY GOV CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST HIM OVERTAKES BY FBI, BRITNEY MURPHY & THEN HER HUSBAND DEATHS BY FBI, WHITNEY HOUSTON DEATH & THEN BOBBY CHRISTINA HER YOUNG DAUGHTER BY FBI, TIGER WOODS & HIS FAMILY W/VOICEOVER IMPLANTING IMPOSSIBLE AMOUNTS OF VILE ME TOO CRAP SCENARIOS SET UP BY RICH AND WEALTHY ACTORS TO STEAL VAST WEALTH FROM HIGH EARNING FAMILIES BY FBI MONEY FUNDED INVESTIGATIONS, MOSSIMO & LORI LAUGHLIN AND HUGE FBI COLLEGES INFILTRATIONS AND MONEY OVERTAKES OF THAT ENTIRE FAMILY & OTHERS & the High Value UC Colleges Systems, OJ SIMPSON AND HORRIFIC PLOTTED FBI MURDER SCENE OF X AND HER MATE IN THEN LATER LA POLPOL OVERTAKE HIS VALUABLE SPORTS COLLECTION & JAIL HIM, MEL GIBSON & HIS FAMILY WITH VOICE OVERTALK EVILS BY FBI, MY BROTHER ROBERT S.

NO CORONER DEATH CERTIFICATE DNA FOR 9 YEARS DUE TO NO BODY OR VALID KNEE BUT CONVICTED BRO ILLEGALLY ON FBI PLANTED HERESAY FOR 15 TO LIFE AND STILL INNOCENTLY IN 25 YEARS NOW. HE WAS VICTIMIZED WITH THESE HEAD SOUNDS AND TRYING TO SAY GHOSTS IN HOUSE AND CRAZY BUT LITERALLY IMPLANTING CRAZY ON HIM (ALL OUR FAMILY HAS CLAIMS AGAINST US GOV & MILITARY IN THIS EVEN MY DEAD PENTAGON VETERANS & ARMY NAVY PARENTS, MY MOTHER WORKED FOR LYNDON B. JOHNSON)AND STEALING MY BROTHERS FIANCE LEAVING HIM WITH A 3MONTH OLD NEWBORN I RAISED FROM 5MOS TO 22 YEARS OLD THAT GOV HAS ALSO PUT ALL THESE TORTURES IN HIM AS EXPERIMENTS SINCE BEFORE HE WAS BORN AND TORTURED WITH THIS EVIL KNOCKING TALKING AND ELECTRICAL MICROWAVE SHOCKING PHYSICAL HARMS(AS BABY SCREAMED AND CRIED 3 HOURS STRAIGHT FOR YEARS, NOONE WOULD BABYSIT HIM EVER 1ST 11MONTHS, & I AS HIS GUARDIAN MOTHER was the only one who could comfort him to stop in any way, the torment with him we all endured is unimaginable Human Torture) FOR GOV MEDICAL DEVIANCE AND INSURANCE SCAMS FRAUD FOR MONEY. Im the only one not afraid to say who are really doing these crimes and we have years of evidence and this PHISHINGSCAM supposedly recorded for research purposes by gov and funded sources has had witnesses to even gov child act hate crimes on my kids youth years ago listed spoken by supposedly marcus lemonis, john lipman, george kosovilka, loser evil president donald trump, fool do nothing president joe biden and on the list can go supposedly with the most horrid evil tales in phishingscams to destroy faith in humanity and test sanity and ability to withstand 24/7nonstop talking, yelling, cursing, threatening, death threats, money offers for buying physical tortures against me, and with threats to my kids and grandkids plus other unmentionables. Wordy Wordsmith Racouteur as someone really telling the truth to stop US Evil spreading funded harms. Dev Moran

>In America Star Power is an evil banner. With stars in phishing scams alongside the political fools truly thinking they are stars in demented plans for nation overtake for threats, offering dates, saying marriages are with them so wonderful, asking for money or sign over my house, tell me they have money to pay me to write a book or pay my bills, or do work for gov, say Im a slave to gov, the scientology or unity churches in San Francisco, slave to the stars group who bought me on darkweb from the gov for torture. So here in US so much also dictated and ruining true society for rich control over everything in Western World. Stars speaking anger and threats or love in phishing scams to steal from us like taylor swift saying my pet is hers and can harm it and you better believe my pets are harmed, harry styles not wanting me to smile and my teeth are harmed, keanu reeves, mark mcgrath who said he wanted a book written about his texas childhood and around the beaches growing up as a boy-I sent him one email explaining I am a writer that would offer a book writing, but I didnt say phishingscam info in email, dolly parton said 2-3weeks ago she'd ""pay police $10,000 to have me killed,"" james carrie wanted my cat, harry styles didnt want me to smile even in my own home and of course I do and then my entire mouth of teeth was ruined, will smith, matt mcCoughnahey worried about my teeth and theyve stated have to keep me away from reporting this to dentist or affording get it fixed over a year now and so teeth get worse for more hate crimes on women, selma hayek said I was a terrible Mother and said she was a Columbian drug lord and could have me killed in the Columbian jungle and a running with the tigers and wild cats by stars like jennifer aniston and my family for phishscams crimes to their deaths etc cosplay voiceover came from that horrid conversation, and hundreds more with the people on that darkweb violence home invasion and more polits run phishscams on innocent people with 10s of thousands of the most deviant stories on evil and death threats constantly. These stars of hollywood have a responsibility to tell and stop this evil. I've seen other cases and reports on this mega money maker for rich funding home violence invasion scams as they call it. Famous lives too have fbi violence crimes that ruined them in impossible groups for greed like BILL COSBY SON MURDERED THEN BILL COSBY LIFE ABSORBED, WHITNEY HOUSTON & THEN DAUGHTER, BRITNEY MURPHY & THEN HUSBAND TOO, MEL GIBSON & FAMILY, OJ SIMPSON & HIS X WITH HER BOYFRIEND IN IT, TIGER WOODS AND HIS FAMILY, & Ive come up with the HUXTIBLE-COSBY ACT TO PROTECT STARS AND ALL FAMILIES IN US AGAINST THE UNDERWORLD TITLE & LIVES TAKEOVERS FOR PROFIT ETC. I can tell you 5G is used for sending microwave currents into wherever they implant wires/diodes into the body, even whales & ocean mammals are being tortured killed with this evil by sonic booms, loud knocking inside them and heard/witnessed by whole towns because its still being called tested and money by gov being misappropriated as funding for these evils, even for testing on me and my family. biden has said ""gov gets an insurance check too on me at the end of the year"" for other evil misappropriations. I can explain as a victim that when they put a 1st round of this 5G into my head, my face, my ears, my teeth, my nose, my throat, my temples, my forehead, my lips, my eyes a large group of polits, fbi, police, family forced in, stars including marcus lemonis with george kosovilka police as gov turned the 5G ~364 microwave current on so high for 3 days nonstop and what happens is blinding, head spinning, vertigo is caused by this stuff on purpose, nausea like COVID on purpose, but I threw up, peed, crapped, drooled, cried and eyes ooze goop, they dry out, force out, and cook out the moisture/water content in our body parts they do this laser microwave torture on all at the same time uncontrollably on the toilet over and over until it was dry heaves and bile, and my rectum pushing uncontrollably while they narrated in this phishingscam with marcus lemonis telling george kosovilka to turn it off and doing a famous whos on first, whos on second round robin of are you turning it off? Okay you're not turning it off, well what are you doing to her then? and constant group bully entertainment for sadist cult attacker fiends. Stars/stars voices and names used say we dont care 100 times over and over for 1 1/2 years now while threats they make are described in anger against my reporting this, or my doing work towards ministering to the evil problems of this being forced on people for these to steal our homes with Bank of the West involvement and participation, and City of Newman with the police. State of California has blocked my proper payments for unemployment again. For over 3 months now and last time they did block my UI payments 4 months february to june making a nightmare of my credit, safety, and gas etc. for job search. As a Minister ordained online with Universal Life Church I was acclamating my years long christian life for myself and my commitment at good in life. In these harrowing evils and near death experiences I have done my usual bible reading and ministering lessons of the teachings of good and evil to much gall and chagrin on me to minister to torturers and thieves of my life. I do not enjoy the female version of Jesus on my beautiful lifetime built and am grateful for. My books I offer for support exposing theses over 20 years evils and over 40years since gov/political/military inception on my Army Sargeant Father and our famjly and those directed suffering evils also as GOV BETRAYERS, and WITH BIDEN is the tool a next regime is in the evils of grevious parties previoius crimes as they all accept passing the scepter and phishingscam crowd prove their version of crazy victim making crime evidence how evil they will go in family harms on US Citizen innocent families. They steal my mail, my emails right before I find it to open even, drop my calls, erase my funding & remove payments, block my Twitter Victims Witness Statement Proof Of Life to stop my reporting or succeeding ending decades of gov rich endentured servant kidnaps over our lives. Thank you saying its difficult in China, Tibet for trade on an olympics was horrendous evils, too. Smiles.",1636473716.0

I won‚Äôt elaborate anymore, I‚Äôm sure you remember it well, and even as I‚Äôm typing it I am still utterly flabbergasted that thousands of people actually believed this.

From the study above, when talking about 5G: 

""The range and magnitude of potential impacts of 5G technologies are under-researched, although important biological outcomes have been reported with millimeter wavelength exposure. These include oxidative stress and altered gene expression, effects on skin and systemic effects such as on immune function (74). In vivo studies reporting resonance with human sweat ducts (73), acceleration of bacterial and viral replication, and other endpoints indicate the potential for novel as well as more ommonly recognized biological impacts from this range of frequencies, and highlight the need for research before population-wide continuous exposures."" 

I can imagine where that conspiracy theory came from.. ""acceleration of bacterial and viral replication"" - This doesnt prove anything by the way, but people see what they want to see.

6am - Wake up. Roll off of my pile of money that Big Telco gave me. Cry myself back to sleep as it barely covers the house renovations. That private 5G-shielded island also wasn't cheap.

7:00am - Wake up again and replace my tinfoil jammies with tinfoil work clothes. Go to the kids room, wake them up and do the same with them.

7.30am - Go and walk the dog. She doesnt have any tinfoil on her as my instructions were clear to kill all the animals as quickly as possibly.

8.30am - Get to work. Morning coffee meeting with colleagues to set the goals for today and exchange new ideas how to inflict maximum amount of damage to the general public. 

9:30am - Join the conference call with Bill Gates to see what the timeplan of spreading diseases is today.

10.30am - I receive customer complaints about the health concerns. Open my word document with a script for misinformation and go through it. Not able to answer any real questions, I quickly trace the location of the callers, select a random disease and send it through.

12am - Time for my daily task of controling peoples minds. Watch outside and laugh maniacally as the victims start mass choreographed shuffling dance as per my instructions. Oh, that sweet, sweet power. 

1:30pm - As the mind control started becoming boring after exausthing all of my ideas, proceed to Facebook and Reddit to randomly spread misinformation. Moderate success. Not satisfied, I contact my foreign colleagues to administer some oppressive measures and scold them about their lack of action to suppress the truth-tellers.


2pm - On my way to lunch, an activist starts shouting the truth about our devil's work. I immediately create beamforming to burn a hole in his head, can't have the truth out there.

3pm - Meeting on my daily progress, with a hefty reward for meeting the goals already. I'm given the option to go home early. I refuse as I have some unsettled scores from the past. I crank the frequency to 60GHz to aspyxiate some activists. They cant spread the truth if they cant breathe. 

4pm - Laugh at the activists burning 2G towers as they don't know that they are already injected with 5G via nanochips. Thank god for Bill Gates and his vaccination plan. Spend some more time posting misinformation on social media.

4.30pm - Time to go home, the dog has to be exposed more to the deadly beams. 

5pm - Walking the dog with my kids, people are staring and laughing at our tinfoil attires. I laugh on the inside while watching them develop cancer right in front of me. Teach the kids a life lesson - ""it's better to be alive and have Big Telco cash, then dead"". They nod in approval. So proud. I'll get them into the industry as soon as they get out of tinfoil diapers.

6pm - Playtime with the kids, using company equipment they zap the birds and the bees in the backyard. We make a snack out of them. Neighbor sees us but I quickly mind control him to forget all about it.

9pm - Time for bed. Before that, I tape the WiFi router and 2 phones to the dogs head and leave them to download 100 TB of garbage data throughout the night. 

9.30pm - Tuck in my tinfoil jammies and dream about that new private jet the Big Telco money will buy me, to fly me to my island some day.",1589529035.0

On the surface level, it seems you can switch off 5G connectivity via a toggle. 

If you disable 5G via the toggle will your phones 5G antennae still be receiving the EMF waves, and just not actually using it for internet connectivity.

I hope this makes sense...

If this IS the case, if one wishes to avoid 5G radiation, is it better to buy a 4G phone VS a 5G phone and use the 5G toggle?

Locations of Reviews - Norfolk, Virginia. Supposedly great coverage for 5G...

Verizon ""#1 in awards for Network Quality."" and T-Mobile (Advertised 72‚Äì245 Mbps) seem to be in the process of forcing 5G onto people. I know Verizon does it and i hear the same is for T-Mobile users... but i could be wrong :)

Verizon - I personally used my Galaxy S23 for about 4 months from Verizon without changing a thing. In the last week I've done some things with my phone so now it uses 4G again. You used to be able to change it, but with all their software updates, you have to use the 5G. They are always in the process of more updates to combat Apps that let you change from 4G and 5G.

T-Mobile - 5G WI-FI decently priced... if it only worked! Below I'll post my results from a few hours of a test i did today using [Testmy.net](https://testmy.net/). This is an every day occurrence. You could be watching a YouTube video at a nice 1080p60, but then it'll switch to buffering for about 5-15 minutes on average. Or you can watch it on 144p or 240p ""with some buffering"". The longest downtime was for about 45 minutes to date.

In summary... If you can, avoid it until it's mandatory, wait. 4G is a touch slower, but 4G LTE users will be fine for the next 5 years unless you're dying to have 4K videos on your phone and live next to a tower.

553,Why India‚Äôs 5G Transition must be Underpinned with Security?,5GDebate,2,131kl1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/5GDebate/comments/131kl1d/why_indias_5g_transition_must_be_underpinned_with/,0,"As we stand at the brink of the 5G era, the transition promises to be a watershed moment in India's digital journey, with immense potential to transform the country's telecommunications industry. 

But its promise is evenly matched by the problems it'll introduce, mostly in regard to cybersecurity. That's why India's move to millimeter-wave technology must have a strong security foundation to ensure that only us consumers can take advantage of the faster bandwidths and data-sharing capabilities, and not malicious entities as well.

**What Threats Does the 5G Transition Pose?**

Since 5G will finally introduce an all-software network, we'll finally move to decentralized digital routing methods, which will eliminate hubs and chokepoints. However, this has one setback. It'll be much more difficult to set up firewalls and security measures since there are no junctures in the network through which all the traffic flows.

Moreover, virtualizing hardware-first functions previously will also open up a few chinks in the security armor. It'll take many patches before the security becomes airtight. The real battle is to identify vulnerabilities with speed and patch them as they come. 

Other than that, the larger bandwidth availability is inevitably going to speed up cyberattacks as well. 

At the end of the day, we must be ready to take on these challenges with not only a reactive mindset but also a proactive one. 

**But How?**

India's 5G transition must be founded on a security-first approach that prioritizes cutting-edge authentication and encryption measures, risk-based security protocols, and trusted and secure components from reputable vendors. 

To achieve this, regulatory oversight and governance must be established to provide clear guidelines and regulations for the deployment and operation of 5G networks, including stringent requirements for security and privacy. Neglecting to implement these measures could result in significant security risks, including data breaches, network downtime, and even physical damage.

Moreover, as India transitions to 5G, we must also be cognizant of the emerging security risks that come with expanding new technologies. As more devices and systems become connected, the attack surface for potential security breaches increases. Thus, India's telecommunication industry must remain vigilant and adapt to the ever-changing security landscape, with continuous monitoring and updates to its security framework.

Plus, we leaders must also prioritize cybersecurity education and training to create a cybersecurity-aware culture among all stakeholders. Network operators, vendors, and users must possess the necessary knowledge and skills to detect and respond to potential security threats effectively. By doing so, stakeholders can maintain the integrity of India's 5G ecosystem.

While a robust security framework and cybersecurity education and training are essential, they alone cannot guarantee the safety of India's 5G ecosystem. The establishment of an agile and responsive incident response framework is a critical step in mitigating the impact of security breaches. The framework must leverage state-of-the-art technology and procedures that can identify and contain threats quickly, reducing the damage and impact of potential security breaches.

All in all, India's transformation to a 5G nation must be bolstered by equally ground-breaking security methodologies and evolving postures to ensure that the full potential of the fifth generation can be harnessed.",1682666448.0

This is the paint [https://www.yshield.com/abschirmfarben/hsf54/yshield-hsf54-standard-abschirmfarbe-1-l iter\_139\_1070/](https://www.yshield.com/abschirmfarben/hsf54/yshield-hsf54-standard-abschirmfarbe-1-liter_139_1070/)  


On top of that it was applied the normal paint for color the walls.  


Now I come to know that the shielding paint must have been grounded, but mine is not.  


My question: what's the real risk of having that conductive surface on the exterior of my loft, not grounded? There is nothing electrical close to that like boilers or batteries or power sockets.

More info at https://safetechinternational.org

Our aim is to gather people who oppose the introduction of non-transparent/harmful/non-verified 5G wireless technology.

Electro-Magnetic Radiation (EMR) has been proven harmful to humans and the environment. Numerous peer-reviewed studies have shown harmful biological effects on Public Health and Ecology. At the same time, the industry has provided no evidence that it is safe.

The International Appeal - Stop 5G on Earth and in Space* has by now gathered over 300:000 signatories from 215 countries and territories. It has been signed by thousands of Scientists who have performed independent studies showing clear harm from EMR.** They are the ones we should listen to. Not what telecommunication companies say.

Measures must be taken to protect humanity and the environment, in accordance with ethical imperatives and international agreements. 

To roll out 5G without independent Health or Environmental impact Assessments (i.e. without Due Diligence) and without Public Consultations goes directly against the Precautionary Principle, enshrined in EU Law, as well as the Right to informed Public Consent, enshrined in UN Law. People have not given their consent to 24/7 ubiquitous, pulsed, modulated, high frequency radiation.

WE WILL STAND UP FOR OUR RIGHTS AND SHOW THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE OVER OUR OWN LIVES.

This is a politically independent action and it is grassroots based. We are searching for reliable people who will organise, coordinate and share information about this action in their cities and areas. Please share so we can organise 5G Protests worldwide. Please share your thoughts, ideas and positive approach.

HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT*** ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW UNVERIFIED TECHNOLOGIES.

5G TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE PUT INTO COMMERCIAL USE WITHOUT INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION. 

NO INDEPENDENT STUDIES - NO 5G TECHNOLOGY

Then almost every day as I was either using my cell or studying on my laptop I started to get red burning blotches on my face and arms, mostly on the right side. 

Felt like someone was either laser infection or microwaving me in these same spots. 

Then as months went on the spots were contained to each pointer finger, mid inner arm(in between wrist and elbow) and on the side of my upper arms directly in the middle, as well as on each cheek. These spots felt like there were being radiated, they were tingling, burning hot to me not necessarily when someone touched it to feel.

Booster shot received January 2022 and started to experience tinnitus in both ears (extreme sizzling sounds, ringing, buzzing, etc) 

Then my feet started to burn and get hot, tingle and not the sides of each calf are numb.

In the last month started experiencing vibration internally starting at my feet and radiating to the sides of my vaginal area. It tingles and vibrates and occasionally I feel tingling or spasms in my stomach.

All of this is extremely scary to me as I don‚Äôt know if this is nerve damage from having had Covid, having had the Covid vaccine/booster, or what some conspiracy theorists say is the 5G nano particles? 

Also around the same time I was hacked and sent messages like forget crypto mining lets go people mining. I‚Äôm going to die a long slow painful death, my insides will turn to mush.

My Wi-Fi and devices were all hacked and my network was ARP poisoned. I was told I was being gang stalked. We could not activate any new cellphones, you could hear the power in our house, our radio exploded when plugged it in. We started hearing propellers outside but did not see anything. Months later we say a white light hovering in the sky moving, sometimes several. Then we noticed one or 2 following us for about 30 minutes back home(we have video)


I am a mess and don‚Äôt know what to do.

1. Joe Mercola, DO. Mercola is at the top of the [CCDH's Disinformation Dozen](https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen), the top spreaders of lies and nonsense about COVID19 vaccines and therapies. He has self-published the book EMF\*D: 5G, Wi-Fi & Cell Phones: Hidden Harms and How to Protect Yourself, chock full of fake science and false claims about 5G. He also funds others in the anti-tech movement. He has paid millions in fines to the FTC for making false claims about the tanning beds he used to sell from his enormous online store.
2. Bob Kennedy Jr, Esg. A former environmental lawyer and heroin addict, he's the founder of Children's Health Defense and the World Mercury Project. Junior led the movement to remove mercury compounds from childhood vaccines on the basis that they cause autism. Most have now been removed, yet the autism rate continues to climb. CHD has filed multiple lawsuits against the FCC in an attempt to stop the 5G rollout, even claiming victory in one case remanded to the FCC for further explanation. Another member of the Disinfo Dozen.
3. Jeffrey Smith, former levitation teacher for the Transcendental Meditation cult. Smith has written two books opposing biotechnology, touted lawsuits against the herbicide glyphosate, and founded organizations seeking to ban vaccines and 5G, such as Americans for Responsible Technology and [Citizens for Health](https://citizens.org/).
4. Jim Turner, Esq. Turner is a tort lawyer based in Washington DC who owns and operates a fake think tank known as The National Institute for Science, Law, and Public Policy. NISLAPP provides fancy-looking credentials to people like Timothy Schoechle, the journalism PhD who campaigns against 5G across the country. Turner is a co-founder of Citizens for Health.
5. Martin Pall, PhD.

## Abstract

Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near ¬Ω Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.

Sharing a [podcast I did last year](https://hightechforum.org/attack-of-the-5g-truthers/). Click on the link to see a blog post summarizing the current science on 5G safety. 

Thomas Johnson, the General Counsel at the FCC, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post earlier this month titled ‚Äú[5G conspiracy theories threaten the U.S. recovery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/04/5g-conspiracy-theories-threaten-us-recovery/).‚Äù It deals with the roadblocks to deployment of 5G networks created by the technology-hesitant 5G Truther movement.

Just like the truther movements that oppose vaccination, genetically engineered foods, modern medicine, and masks to prevent the spread of the virus behind COVID-19, 5G Truthers offer a warped analysis based on extensive cherry-picking and pseudo-science. In this podcast, we cover the arguments made by the truthers, demographics, tactics, and the burden of fighting misinformation campaigns city-by-city and county-by-county.

Truthers target the city councils charged with modernizing the permitting process for small cells, preying on the ignorance of local officials ill-equipped to counter alternative facts about radio spectrum and epidemiology. The technology and innovation community face a daunting challenge: we need to get information out to local decision makers that they can understand about these complex topics.

In order to help with this, FCC General Counsel Johnson recorded a podcast with us. You can find an audio version at the top of the page, a YouTube here, and also a Facebook version on the [High Tech Forum page](https://www.facebook.com/hightechforum/).",1638567154.0

708,Why I don't fear the radio,5GDebate,2,r87vn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/5GDebate/comments/r87vn2/why_i_dont_fear_the_radio/,20,"Radio has been part of our lives since we took our first breaths.

The world's [first commercial radio station](https://www.britannica.com/topic/KDKA), **KDKA**, began broadcasting in Pittsburgh in 1920. In  1928 **W3XK**, the [first American](https://www.wired.com/2012/07/july-2-1928-americas-first-tv-station-goes-air/) TV station, went on the air in  suburban Washington DC. In 1941, FM station [**W47NV** went on the air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting_in_the_United_States) in Nashville. In 1972, the [Open Skies initiative](https://www.hudson.org/research/9652-open-skies-and-open-spectrum-the-occasional-power-of-simple-ideas) legalized communication satellites, making cable TV possible.

In 1973, [Marty Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Cooper_(inventor)) made the [first mobile telephone call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mobile_phones) from handheld subscriber equipment. But the history of radio communications goes back a lot further: in the 1890s Oliver Lodge and Guglielmo Marconi [demonstrated systems for mobile telegraph](https://www.jstor.org/stable/310650?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) for trains.

Most of the data that traverses the Internet today begins or ends on a mobile device. In the 125 years of mobile data scientists have studied ways to make radios better, faster, more efficient and safer. One repository of scientific studies about radios and human health -  [EMF Portal at RWTH Aachen University in Germany](https://www.emf-portal.org/en) \- houses 40,000 scientific studies and summaries on the topic.

Oddly, some are still afraid of radios. This came to my attention in 1990 when I took on a consulting assignment with Photonics, a company in Los Gatos California that was selling a [wireless version of the AppleTalk local area network called Photolink](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/business/the-executive-computer-networking-without-the-wires.html). The first version of Photolink was proprietary, which limited its appeal. So the company joined forces with others to create an international standard for wireless LANs that would permit users to mix and match equipment from multiple vendors. This effort became IEEE 802.11, now known as Wi-Fi.

Photonics hired me to help them recast their design into a form that would meet the approval of the IEEE Standards Association's Project 802. I had successfully created the first standard for Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair wiring so I had some knowledge of the standards world.

The thing I was most surprised about was the company's decision to use infrared (IR) light rather than radio frequency (RF) energy for its physical signaling part. The other companies working on 802.11 used unlicensed radio frequencies, newly made available by the FCC. By contrast with RF, IR had limited propagation and low speed.

Photonics wanted to sell to schools, and they were aware that small groups of parents were already expressing concerns about possible health risks from the cell phones that were becoming more common. The science on cellular and health didn't suggest issues, but that didn't prevent worried parents from banding together to combat what they saw as threats to their children's health. So I've been aware of radiophobia since 1990.

In particular, radiophobes were afraid that cell phones would cause cancer. This made intuitive sense since we hold cell phones to our ears, where they have a direct path to the brain. [Since the '70s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098028/), the [rate of brain cancer in the US has not increased](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/brain.html), however. In fact, it has declined a bit.

[US Cancer rates since 1992 source: National Cancer Institute](https://preview.redd.it/xqnh940t3l381.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c5e5bfe708f767fe68b8ad505670422fcb1d478)

Yet the fears remain even though the claims have changed a bit. For those of us who grew up in the 50s and 60s, the fear of radios is bizarre. Radio has been part of our lives forever, and we've never regarded it has a health risk. Like most people, I regard radiophobia with puzzlement, much like opposition to vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and bio-engineered seeds or beliefs that the Earth is flat or that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

Every new technology seems to spawn an opposition movement: electricity was the target of activists spreading health fears, Luddites opposed steam power, and there were probably cave people who found fire too scary for common use. That's the way humans roll.

Regulators base their assessments on the work of largely international bodies such as ICNIRP (International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), ICES (International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety), and SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks). These bodies examine the science literature on EMFs and health and propose limits on the power levels and other properties of RF energy transmitted from cellular base stations.

They revise guidelines on a regular basis considering new technologies and new science on mechanisms of harm. ICES did its most recent review in 2019, ""C95.1-2019 - IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields, 0 Hz to 300 GHz"". You can read it here: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8859679](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8859679)

If you read and understand the whole thing you'll have a big part of the technical literacy necessary to debate 5G safety in a meaningful way. Here's a summary:

The [latest update from the electromagnetic safety committee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8910342) is only a year and a half old, and it covers all relevant research in the area, including the two studies most commonly cited by 5G Truthers, the 2G GSM and CDMA NTP study and the hasty 2G Ramazzini study. IEEE SA covers both thermal effects caused by the heating of tissue as well as the non-thermal effects most commonly cited by truthers. 

Here's the conclusion:

>The literature review also evaluated the possibility of adverse health effects associated with chronic low-level exposure. For exposures to electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields at frequencies between 0 Hz and 300 GHz, the following two conclusions were reached:  
>  
>1. The weight-of-evidence provides no credible indication of adverse effects caused by chronic exposures below levels specified in IEEE Std C95.1‚Ñ¢-2019.  
>  
>2. No biophysical mechanisms have been scientifically validated that would link chronic exposures below levels specified in IEEE Std C95.1‚Ñ¢-2019 to adverse health effects.  
>  
>Based on the collective findings of recent reviews, the weight of the evidence continues to indicate that chronic exposure at levels specified in this standard is unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Nonetheless, ICES Subcommittees routinely evaluate new research and will, if appropriate, initiate revision of IEEE Std. C95.1-2019.""

I'm new here but have been digging through this subreddit and other 5G/EMF/EHS resources. I think I've been experience symptoms for a long time, yet this year since my 5G iPhone I've had so much worse. I'm hoping to receive some thoughts, answers, or just validation/support over this because this is foreign to all the doctors I've seen this year and what it seems to be is foreign to the USA in particular. I have literally been put on 2 new medications this year, plus an allergy med year round instead of just during spring.

As a child, my dad was in the telecom industry and almost all I took a liking to were computers, other than musical instruments. From Nintendo systems to my dad's desktop, I couldn't stop using these things. Yet, I was experiencing abnormal symptoms at my young age. When I was 8, I started experiencing frequent extreme piercing migraines alongside headache clusters. What's interesting is I had x-rays and all types of radiation-exposure testing. The headaches have not gone away, but finally receiving blue light blocking glasses at age 26 has helped. I was also diagnosed with ADHD, and another undeclared digestive disorder that finally was diagnosed as IBS+GERD. I've been prescribed medication, but these symptoms never seemed to go away, or get all that better. I got through college, albeit having more anxiety and depression symptoms to accompany. My digestive disorder also started getting worse with my career, which involved a lot of data analysis, probably more computer-use in ratio to before.

During 2019 and 2020, I started investing in more wireless technology, mainly because I thought it was awesome. And then I started the year buying an iPhone 12 Pro Max. What throws everything off is in March I received the first dosage of the Pfizer vaccine. Suddenly all my symptoms are incredibly worse...but most of all my hands were unusable. I had to call out of work, start wearing gloves, and visit a rheumatologist. My blood work showed that I was experiencing inflammation, and I was. My fingers were feeling fat and uncomfortable, in pain. This stabbing sensation I had one day stuck with me, because I was using my phone and threw my phone down when it happened. I sometimes get that sensation in my hip still. But it felt like a migraine in my thumb. 

The pains have gone down, but my general life is just so much worse than even 2020. My doctors decided I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer. I've been prescribed a medication for my hands, alongside another IBS medication! Plus have to take allergy medication everyday! If I don't, I literally notice a difference. That's 3 new meds. My entire year and future seem foreign to me. It's caused an extra layer of depression and anxiety because of the unknown with I mean, my entire life. This has been a hell year. Yet, for months now I haven't believed it was JUST the pfizer.

I've now had both Moderna shots which have not brought on an increase in symptoms. However, my overall health has just been declining. It's possible I even have prostatitis because of an increase of UTI infections. I've developed more rashes, including ringworm on my skin. It's just all this new stuff kept popping up.

Eventually the feeling my phone was a factor went on far too long. So I traded in my 12 Pro Max for a 13 Pro, thinking the size/weight could have an effect. Even though the grip is better now, my hands are actually worse now!! Not as bad as in March but worse than with my 12 Pro Max. I started turning off cellular, low and behold my hands are actually feeling a bit better. It must be the electromagnetic radiation, and that the 13 pro is more powerful...

Alongside, I started hardwiring as many devices as possible and cutting off orbis. For some reason, the atmosphere just feels better in my apartment. Driving to work on airplane mode and just downloaded music playing honestly did feel better. I'm still worried there is some placebo‚Ä¶

Few years ago one of Hindu priest signalled that somebody is using these powerful yogic and tantric practices which is causing high degree of change in the environment. After which many mysterious death of animals and bird have been seen. These yantras belong to Tantric sect of Shaktism in Hinduism. It is belived that this sect of Hinduism was born in modern day Bihar near Madhubani and Sitamarhi. 

Another finding that was noticed was that in the proximity of these areas many villages were adopted by Gates Foundation namely Khagaria and Guleria. 

In Tantricism one of the most important branch of study is 'Vashikarana' meaning 'to subjugate'. Many yogic practitioners are easily able to control other peoples mind and make them do anything they want. These objects activate only at specific vibrations which can be generated either by sacred mantras or by modern methods of shooting electromagnetic waves.

If the 5G antennas are used to amplify the frequency from these tantras this can allow big billionaires to control and subjugate entire population of countries including military. 

We all know about the fact that rich billionaires have been using black magic and also have been reviving satan worshiping in America and parts of world, in which Bill Gates is also one of the big proponents.

If you believe these two to be interconnected then the whole push regarding 5G is busted. These are tools for mind control",1624023884.0

The deployment of 5G is expected to increase power density levels drastically, given the limitations of mmWave communications that impose a notably higher number of base stations to cover a given area of interest. In this paper, we propose a gradual deployment strategy of a 5G network for a small area in downtown Austin, Texas, using the already existing 4G LTE sites of the area. "" ...

Have you ever heard of children/ adults that get bee stings and have to be rushed to the hospital?¬† ¬†What about children/adults that eat nuts and they get virtually the same reactions as those with bee stings and they too, have to be rushed to the hospital.¬† There are kits that people can carry to help with these allergic reactions so that the symptoms don‚Äôt progress to dangerous levels.¬† The easiest way to deal with these allergies is to simply avoid them.

Well in the same way, TOO MUCH WIFI/ cell phone use can cause similar reactions in people.¬† Yes, if the usage is excessive than the allergic reactions can progress to dangerous levels.¬† With cell phones, the reactions and bodily symptoms can start small and progress to a point where your thyroid is completely blown out and you are now in full-blown Adrenal Fatigue and start developing Autoimmune diseases.¬† There are many Autoimmune diseases that our medical system does not recognize and can be attributed to Adrenal Fatigue.¬†¬†

This happened to me.¬† ¬†I used my cell phone too much.¬† I used it as a research device instead of going to my laptop.¬† In the beginning, I can see now, that my fatigue often occurred after I was on my cell phone.¬† I would gett burning in my fingertips and then muscle pains developed up my arm and into my chest.¬† When I was on the phone for way too long, I developed heart palpitations and became very anxious and often felt strong feelings of hostility and rage.¬† Finally, the bone between my thumg and forefinger became extremely painful.¬† Once, that happened, I felt a rush of energy/ burning go up one arm, across my throat and down the other.¬† It was like I had been electrocuted.¬† It is taking me awhile to recover from this incident as I am already dealing with heavy metals in my body.¬† This was just another toxin on my list of many that have invaded my body.

Now, I need to be mindful of the frequencies/ wifi around me.¬† I can only have one device near me at a time.¬† If, I have my cell phone on, then my laptop is put on airplane mode.¬† I do not use my cell phone for research.¬† I do not place my cell phone on my body unless it is turned off or on airplane mode.¬† I am also, sensitive to electrical frequencies and since, laptops are not grounded I use a grounding mat under it.¬† I am renting and cannot hardwire my laptop so I try to cut down on placing my fingers diirectly on the desktop by hardwiring my keyboard and my mouse.¬† If I could I would shut down the wifi on the modem and hardwire that too, but it is currently not an option.

So, if you are having symptoms in your body and not feeling at optimal health, then consider that you might be feeling the affects of the wifi that is around you.¬† Do you keep your cell phone on your body?¬† Are living around a cell tower that is close to you?¬† Do you work in an office that is inundated with cell phones/ laptops that are not grounded?¬† ¬†For the best of health, you need to be aware of your environment and take precautionary steps that can help you keep your health at optimal levels.",1615349440.0

*Abstract.*    In the present study the effect of long-term exposure (1 hour/day for 4 months) to electromagnetic radiation field (EMF) (900 MHz, 0.02 mW/cm2, SAR: 1.165 W/kg) on the EEG of freely moving rat is investigated. The spectral analysis of the EEG bands was done after 1, 2 and 4months of daily EMF irradiation and after 1 month of stopping irradiation that extended daily for 4months. The quantitative analysis of EEG revealed a clear shift from high frequency (beta) to lower frequency (delta) in irradiated animals as compared to unexposed animals, which indicated the change in the animal arousal. The cumulative effect of non-thermal EMF has been suggested for chronic exposure to radiation. It could be suggested that EMF cause changes in central cholinergic system that change the cortical excitability that reflected in slowing down of the EEG frequencies.",1614185476.0

**The health effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation: FIAT LUX**  
Diafoirus, AgoraVox, February 11, 2021¬† (Google translation from French)  


¬† ' *Medicine without memory is the ruin of man'*¬†

¬†A rat, a spoon and an ambassador have changed our perception of the health effects of electromagnetic radiation.

¬†In the beginning there was light. After 9 months rocked by the earth's magnetic field in the mother's womb, light is the first electromagnetic radiation that welcomes us. And if we are what we are, it is because of or because of these natural electromagnetic fields. And all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds until in 1745 we were able to store static electricity in a bottle filled with salt water (1746 Leyden bottle). From there, technologies using electricity have multiplied: power line, lighting, telegraphy, radio, radar, screen, computer, mobile telephony, communicating meter, 5G and tomorrow the Internet of things.

Accompanying all this, we noted the appearance of a new pathology, described in 1869 by an American neurologist and which will change its name with technological developments: neurasthenia, telegraph disease, radio wave disease, radar operator disease, screens, telephony illness, syndrome of intolerance to electromagnetic fields or electrohypersensitivity (1).

We also noted the explosion of pathologies known for a long time, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases including hypertension and cancer (2).

Caricaturedly, we can say that from the beginning of the 20th century, scientists were divided into two camps, on the one hand, physicists supported by the authorities and industrialists who asserted that non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation could not be harmful to the environment. man as long as an intensity limit is not exceeded, and on the other hand biologists, botanists, zoologists, veterinarians and physicians who see the effects of low doses of electromagnetic radiation well below the thermal threshold fixed by physicists (3,4,5,6).

In 1960 the US military imposed the physical standard of ten million microwatts per square meter, as the dose limit not to be exceeded for a thirty minute exposure. And since this standard, which takes neither chronic exposure nor biological effects into account, has been imposed on the Western world and governs all current laws in France (7).

However, this did not stop those who every day observed the deleterious effects at low dose of chronic exposure from continuing to denounce the dangerousness of devices using electromagnetic radiation and in particular mobile telephony.

The American government to silence the bad tongues, decided to finance a large-scale study to demonstrate once and for all the absence of risk of appearance of cancer because of the use of a cell phone. The Food and Drugs Administration then asked the National Toxicology Program to do a study on rats and mice, 10 years later and $30 million, the conclusion is without question the cell phone creates cancer in rats without a doubt (8).

¬†At the same time, the Ramazzini institute in Italy published the results of a similar study but reproducing exposure to relay antennas and found the same thing in rats (9). Well annoyed the FDA gets away with saying that these results should not be taken into account, it just means that the rats should not be given cell phones!

So there not to recognize the facts the industrialists and their associates, say that it is false and especially not possible because we do not know the mechanism which allows non-ionizing radiation to act on living beings at these doses and to create cancers. In short, people get sick, but since we don't know how it's possible, then it doesn't exist!

This is where the spoon comes in. The spoon is part of the THERABIONIC a device approved by the FDA and therefore in Europe and France, to treat primary liver tumors. An electromagnetic frequency generator is used here and the spoon serves as an antenna, placed in the mouth it irradiates the body and this at low intensities (10).

Work has shown that the action is via receptor-dependent membrane calcium channels, something already known (11).

In short the FDA is able to say everything and its opposite: YES low dose non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation can act on human cells when it comes to selling medical machines, NO low dose non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation cannot not act on human cells when it comes to selling phones.

This is where the ambassador comes into play, in fact in the American embassies of China and Cuba diplomats were suddenly victims of unexplained disturbances, beginning in the middle of the night with strange noises accompanied by headaches, dizziness and vomiting. and subsequently leading to persistent neurological disorders suggesting for connoisseurs a syndrome of intolerance to electromagnetic fields. The American government, wanting to shed light on these attacks, asked the academies of Medicine, Science and Engineering of the United States of America, to work together to solve this riddle. For them there is little doubt that it is an electromagnetic attack, and in their joint report they endorse what biologists, botanists, zoologists,

So if there is only one thing to take away from this story of a rat, a spoon and an ambassador, it is that you must protect your children and your grandchildren from electromagnetic radiation because if you don't, no one else will.

**DC Circ. Picks Apart FCC Over 5G Wireless Safety Review**

Kelcee Griffis, Law360, Jan 25, 2021

Law360 (January 25, 2021, 6:04 PM EST) -- A D.C. Circuit panel on Monday appeared skeptical of the [Federal Communications Commission](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/agencies/federal-communications-commission)'s support for its own findings that cellphones and other connected devices pose no risks to human health.  


U.S. Circuit Judge Robert L. Wilkins questioned whether the FCC properly cited two working groups under the Federal Drug Administration's umbrella that are supposed to monitor the possibility of wireless harms, saying the FCC failed to explore how these bodies contributed to the record and to substantiate whether they exist at all.¬†  


""I'm just going to be very upfront with why I'm inclined to rule against you,"" Judge Wilkins said. ""Why shouldn't I send it back for the relevant working groups and the [FDA](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/agencies/food-and-drug-administration) to look at this record?""  


Counsel for both the FCC and the health groups challenging the wireless safety rules admitted they don't know if an obscure, statutorily mandated FDA committee on technical standards exists. As to the second committee at issue, an interagency working group through which the FCC and FDA are supposed to collaborate on radio frequency issues, Judge Wilkins expressed dissatisfaction with underlying documents substantiating the committee's existence and activities.  


""I¬†don't see any mention of that working group, and I don't see anything in the record that says that that working group actually exists or looked at any of the evidence in this case,"" he said.  


The lawsuit, [**launched**](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/articles/1296924) in January 2020 by the Children's Health Defense and the Environmental Health Trust, argues that the FCC's rules governing wireless signals and technology don't go far enough to protect consumers, especially when vulnerable populations are exposed to long-term or multiple sources of radiation.  


The health groups challenge the FCC's [**determination**](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/articles/1186818/fcc-chair-says-no-new-radiofrequency-rules-needed-for-5g) ‚Äî based on what it says are multiple health and safety organizations' input and consensus ‚Äî that its wireless safety standards are still effective in protecting people from harmful mobile transmissions, even as the wireless ecosystem has expanded exponentially in recent years.  


""It is simply not correct to say that the entire federal government and all its agencies are entirely aligned on this issue,"" argued attorney W. Scott¬†McCollough, who represents the health groups.  


At the macro level, FCC attorney Ashley Boizelle argued that the FDA has given no indication that FCC rules designed to limit so-called thermal effects, in which wireless transmissions can generate high heat and harm human tissue, need to be changed.  


The agency drew from a variety of sources to reach its conclusion that the 1996 wireless safety rules still apply to the 5G era, Boizelle said, including the [World Health Organization](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/agencies/world-health-organization)'s representation that it found no substantial evidence of harm from fixed wireless facilities.  


U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millett, however, pointed out that the universe of connected devices has exploded in the last 25 years. She said that¬†by¬†accepting some¬†evidence that's limited¬†to¬†""fixed facilities,""¬†the FCC hasn't¬†necessarily addressed the potential harms of popular devices that consumers constantly interact with today and new ones that continually appear in the market.  


""Is an iPad a fixed facility? Is a watch a fixed facility? Is a laptop a fixed facility?"" she said. ""The fixed facility stuff doesn't feel responsive. I'm really curious about all these other devices.""  


But she also appeared open to the possibility that the health groups are posing their questions to the wrong agency.  


""\[Petitioners\] are asserting injuries that are medical,"" Judge Millett said. ""It almost seems like the one you should be talking to is the FDA.""  


Later in the hearing, Judge Wilkins pressed the FCC on¬†whether it too broadly construed FDA commentary that was limited to links between cellphones and cancer as proof that the FCC's old wireless safety regulations protect against any harms that could arise from extremely close and frequent contact with 5G wireless devices.  


""You are asking us to infer something that's significant,"" he said.  


Boizelle responded that the FCC is working with all of the information that has been submitted to its long-running wireless standards inquiry and that the FDA groups in question never discouraged the agency from continuing to use its current limitations.  


""We're not arguing that silence should be construed as endorsement. But it shouldn't be construed as disapproval of the agency's existing limits,"" she said.  


At the end of the hearing, the panel ordered the FCC to file supplementary evidence detailing the existence and composition of the two FDA working groups by the end of the next business day.  


Judges¬†Karen Henderson, Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins sat on the D.C. Circuit panel.  


The petitioners are represented by W. Scott McCollough and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  


The FCC is represented in-house by William J. Scher, Ashley Stocks Boizelle, Jacob M. Lewis and Richard Kiser Welch.  


The case is Environmental Health Trust et al. v. FCC et al., case number [20-1025](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/cases/5e3af9b8a79bdc0034719526), in the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit](https://www-law360-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/agencies/u-s-court-of-appeals-for-the-district-of-columbia-circuit).

First of all, it doesn't at all feel a bit sus to you that 5G towers have been going up for a year and nobody commented on it until now? Secondly, the radiation is non ionizing, and therefore cannot cause serious problems. Finally, 5G is actually less penetrative then LTE, and therefore can't penetrate your body more then LTE signals can.

""A Tennessee man who federal investigators say detonated a bomb in downtown Nashville on Christmas Day may have been paranoid about 5G technology, reports say. 

Investigators say they are now looking into Anthony Warner‚Äôs¬†alleged 5G paranoia¬†and if it motivated the bombing, ABC News reported. Warner, identified as the suspect in the bombing, was¬†killed in the explosion, the FBI said. 

Douglas Korneski, an FBI special agent in charge, told ABC News investigators ‚Äúare aware of certain things online, and we‚Äôre looking at every possible motive.‚Äù That includes whether Warner believed ‚Äú5G technology was being¬†used to spy on Americans,‚Äù WSMV reported. 

The RV linked to the explosion was parked outside of an AT&T building, and the blast caused internet and phone¬†outages throughout Tennessee and surrounding states. Authorities have not determined a motive as of Monday afternoon.

Would you like to repost in r/electromagnetics?

Eight months ago, /u/Reddit_Defends-Pedos inquired about more popular EMF subs in /u/modernmystic369's other sub r/Against5G. No one referred r/electromagnetics and r/invisiblerainbow. Why? /u/modernmystic369 referred only his new sub r/5GDebate. Did you not know of these two EMF subs?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Against5G/comments/fy3zq5/is_there_another_stub_more_popular_than_this_one/

/u/Reddit_Defends-Pedos, did you use Reddit's search engine? How did you find  r/Against5G but the other two EMF subs?  

r/invisiblerainbow is one year old but has only 319 subscribers. r/invisiblerainbow is three months older than r/5GDebate but has fewer subscribers. Few Redditors know the meaning of invisiblerainbow. Perhaps because 5G is in the name of r/5GDebate?   Do Redditors searching for 5G find r/5GDebate but not r/InvisibleRainbow and r/electromagnetics? Is Reddit's search engine hacked?

Does r/electromagnetics come up in a search for 5G? It should as the first word of the title and description of r/electromagnetics is 5G. Wish I could change the name of r/electromagnetics to r/5Gelectromagnetics. 

EMF subs have few subscribers. These three subs are the remaining EMF subs. The others EMF subs have quickly become inactive.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/gh9cve/inactive_emf_subs/

Edited: On December 30, 2020, I discovered five month old /r/EMFDangers . The sub has the sole mod /u/Funny_Smack_85 and only 11 subscribers. I crossposted this post in r/EMFDangers and asked /u/Funny_Smack_85 why a new EMF sub was created.

https://www.reddit.com/r/EMFDangers/comments/kn2prk/why_was_remfdangers_created_did_ufanny_smack_85/

r/electromagnetics is five years old but only has 2,770 subscribers. For past nine months, r/electromagnetics has been a restricted sub due to lack of active mods. Temporarily becoming a restricted sub and competition with r/5GDebate decreased the number of new subscribers. 

Subs modded by a sole mod have a shorter life.  All the inactive EMF subs listed above had only one mod. The mod becomes inactive. He does not refer other subs before becoming inactive. Nor does the mod repost the best of their posts in other subs before becoming inactive. The inactive subs are ignored.  The information in the posts are lost to new Redditors.  My requests in r/electromagnetics to repost good posts from inactive subs have been ignored.

My search is hacked. No subs come up when I use Reddit's search engine. I logged out of Reddit to be able to conduct a search of 5G subs. I typed 5G in Reddit's search engine. Just a few subs were brought up: r/conspiracy, r/technology, etc. No EMF subs. I changed the search term to ""5G health.""  First sub Reddit's search engine brought up was r/HealthAnxiety, a sub for hypochondriacs. r/invisiblerainbow, r/5Gkills  and private sub r/COVID19_5G came up but not r/5GDebate and r/electromagnetics. Perhaps a private sub was created to replace EMF subs that should have been brought up by Reddit's search engine?

I changed the first two words in the title and description of r/electromagnetics to 5G Health. Reddit's search engine brought up r/electromagnetics for now. I have found over the five years of r/electromagnetics, that the sub is repeatedly dropped from Reddit's search engine. 

Reddit's search engine does not prioritize subs by seniority or number of subscribers. r/electromagnetics is the oldest EMF sub and the largest but was not  brought up. r/5GKills is the newest, being only seven months old and has only 32 subscribers. u/thecombatturtle did you create r/5GKills because you could not find any EMF subs? r/5GKills is a restricted sub which is probably why it has only 32 subscribers. I sent a modmail asking for this post to be crossposted.

The mods of r/electromagnetics have worked hard researching, submitting and debating studies, researching shielding, submitting shielding reports, meter reviews, meter reports, answering questions, etc. Hardly worth it the time and effort for a sub that remains tiny due to censorship.

There is currently a knowledge gap in regards to how high frequency emissions affect small surface area tissue like the eyes and testes. It‚Äôs kind of weird that 5G is being rolled out despite this knowledge gap which signals conflict of interest, I think.

Everything You Need To Know About 5G Technology5G TechnologyNew TechBy sam5G technology has become a real tech buzzword in 2020 and everyone is talking about how incredibly fast internet connection it can deliver to mobile devices. However, since the average users are already enjoying high-speed internet connection and download thanks to 4G LTE, can 5G make any difference in their lives?

In this article, we‚Äôre going to discuss the origin of the 5G technology, how it works, and what are the other potential benefits of 5G beyond the increase in data speed.

So, without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in‚Ä¶

What Is 5G Technology And How Was The Journey To 5G Like?5G is the fifth generation of wireless communication and network technology that aligns with the 3GPP standards. This is essentially the next generation of cellphone and wireless communication network that is already spreading across many cities of the US and the other countries around the world. And it is believed that this will create a new path towards the network connectivity which might have a whole set of new and interesting uses.

In 1979, we witnessed the first introduction of the first generation wireless communication network with 800 MHz spectrum which we know as the 1G. And thanks to that, people all around the world were capable of calling other people with a cellphone. And then back in 1991, we‚Äôre introduced to the 2G. This made sending text messages, images, and videos over the cellphone. This utilized the 1.9 GHz network spectrum.

2. Extremely high levels of radiation (watts per m2 or cm2) multiple orders of magnitude over what one experiences from technology.

3. Effects are indistinguishable from equivalent thermal effects, or there is no thermal control group.

4. The study simply says an effect was observed, but not that the effect was bad or caused a disease.

5. Scientifically flawed, no control group, small sample size, not reproducible, not peer reviewed, etc.

Among the scientific reviews documenting these various non-thermal health effects are 170 that follow.¬† Each of these reviews cites at least a dozen primary literature citations showing non-thermal effects, with many citing 100 or more going up to the 3rd reference which cites over 1000 such citations.¬† It can be seen from this that the primary literature citations supporting the existence of various non-thermal health effects cited in these reviews go into several thousands.¬† This list is not and is not intended to be a list of all important such reviews.¬† However it gives some measure of the size of the literature that contradicts the industry contention that there are no non-thermal effects of microwave frequency EMFs.",1598308532.0

1382,A rf-emf story,5GDebate,6,i3uqjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/5GDebate/comments/i3uqjs/a_rfemf_story/,12,"I wanted to share my experience of relationship to cellphone and emf exposure, how is changed and where it is now. 

I'm thirty-three years old, and received my first Nokia cellphone in high school around the age of seventeen.

I used it like most any other kid at the time I suppose, playing Snake, texting cute girls (sometimes being lucky and getting a text back) and as a way to get a hold of my parents, or, more often, for them to get a hold of me. 

I didn't sleep with it under my pillow, like some psychopath, but did sleep with it next to my bed often, and never really questioned any potential health effects. 

Then later on, when I was in college, I remember a debate/discussion on the possibility of an association between cellphone use and cancer on a major news network program. 

Some participates were leaning towards there being such an association while others were not. The take away I remember was if one was worried, to put a few inches of distance between oneself and one's cellphone, and that would mitigate any a potential risk (I was glad I didn't sleep with my cellphone). 

Fast-forward to early 2019, I saw a [documentary](https://youtu.be/ol3tAxnNccY) making extraordinary claims of the dangers of cellphones and the upcoming 5G in particular. I found all the claims made in the documentary hard to believe, although there were some seemingly credible scientists making some of the claims regarding the potential dangers, which peaked my interests. 

I filled it away as hopefully and most likely, for the most part, untrue. A few months later I started looking into the issue more and found a [presentation](https://youtu.be/BwyDCHf5iCY) by Dr. Devra Davis to be rather convincing and more level headed. 

I continued my investigation in the issue online, coming across troubling [reviews in the literature](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236913127_Cell_phone_radiation_exposure_on_brain_and_associated_biological_systems ) as well as reviews that suggested [no clear evidence of harm](https://www.dkfz.de/en/medphys/appl_med_rad_physics/download/Paper_Mobile_Phones.pdf), these latter studies made me feel relieved. 

The more I investigated, however, the more I realized those studies and, in particular, the bodies responsible for setting the safety guidelines for exposure to these frequencies were influenced by a thermal-only theory for damages by these frequencies - dependent upon high levels of power, which are prevented by the current guidelines. 

I discovered the [inherent conflict of interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/5GDebate/comments/hs3b9o/comment_health_risks_from_radiofrequency/) within industry and government alike in regards to safeguarding this thermal-only theory at the expense of public health, as they ignore the majority of the relevant scientific literature demonstrating risk of adverse health effects at low-intensity, athermal exposures to these frequencies. 

Slowly but eventually I came to the conclusion that the guidelines of 10W/m2 and the SAR standard of protection - which, by design, only protects against damages induced by thermal heating of tissue - as wholly inadequate when weighted against the evidence for non-thermal effects due to low-intensity exposures typical in everyday use of smartphones, Wi-Fi, etc..

So I continued to investigate and started to share what I'd discovered with friends and family. Largely met with difficulty, I started this subreddit, as I'd get banned for trying to share peer-reviewed literature on the issue in other well established subreddits. 

As it now stands, I don't have Wi-Fi and limit time on my smartphone while on my body. I carry it in airplane mode and only use it in speaker mode while talking.

I spent many hrs looking for scientific literature in the high hills with little cell service, which I know increases the exposure and did so because my time to investigate was limited so I took the opportunities I had. Hope my investigation into the issue doesn't fall upon deff ears. 

I thank all of the members on both sides of this issue and hope we can dialog in respectful discourse on this serious matter.",1596585264.0

Just think about it; if the 5G is supposed to give worldwide connectivity and network access, then that clearly means that the radiation will be sky rocketting. If with 4g, we have a whole countries network, then imagine the power 5g is going to have, for it to reach worldwide. A test was conducted where all the animals in the area died of too much radiation activity. I keep reading articles where they say that your wifi has more radiation? are you joking? how can wifi have more radiation than 5G?

If there is research, preferably early, showing injury or wrongful death.  (If), then someone could sue say Tom Wheeler, or the FCC for negligence.   If someone won, or a foundation was formed to start suing on the basis of tort law, you could run that like a business.  Essentially sue, reinvest in more lawyers, sue again, rinse and repeat and batter them in the courts.  It's not directly a way to 'Regulate the telecommunications industry on the basis of human health', which would be preferable, but it's a way to fuck them up and hold politicians and civil servants accountable,  strip them of that bribe money and re allocate those resources to the plaintiffs.  That might even make bribe money, or super PAC money less appealing, like a trap.  In the future that could be our reality, honest civil servants unmoved by lobbies because of the constant reminder that that money will be taken away.

Let me be clear, I'm on 5G debate, but this could be done now, today with 4G, 3G, smartmeters, what have you, you could sue the electric companies like a business.  The studies are there.

Pain Gone - diagnosis Fibromyalgia

Alternative methods tried: strict veganism, 1 year, failed 

Starvation: up to one week, over the course of years, failed 

No sugar: one year, failed 

WiFi cessation in the home, pain fatigue decreased but not eliminated. Pain fatigue still debilitating despite limitations on self exposure.

8 days in Faraday cage: No pain after day 1, no pain on any subsequent day following sleep in Faraday cage up to 12 hours.  Increased energy, able to stand, walk, lift, work with no fatigue for up to 12 hours following sleep in Faraday cage.  Brighter skin.  Hair loss slowed.  Reduction of sexualization, hypersexuality and sexualized anger.  Significant increase in peace and comfort, physically and mentally.  No alcohol cravings, alcohol intake no longer a pain relief, tension reduction necessity, but almost completely benign.   Inability to hold alcohol, vomiting.  Brighter more clear vision.  Emotions re-emerging, but not with any lack of control.  Inability to overeat, significant discomfort with any overconsumption.  New sensitivity to caffeine.  Teeth feel more strong. Sensation returning generally, including organ sensation.  Happiness returning.  HS no new symptoms, no new sores.  Skin health, much better.  Connection with spouse deepening.
